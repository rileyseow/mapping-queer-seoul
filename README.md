## About
Lying at the intersection of the digital humanities and Korean studies, this project is interested in the preservation and accessibility of an informational and photographic archive of lived queer experience in South Korea during the second half of the twentieth century. 

The site aims to localize and visualize the physical spaces that were taken up, repurposed, and/or queered by South Koreans during a period of rapid industrialization, growing economic inequality, and authoritarian rule â€” circumstances which presented unique and difficult constraints for sexual and gender non-conforming groups. 

In particular, the end of the Korean War (1953) until South Korea's first democratic elections (1987) saw the country under various dictatorships which disseminated particularly stringent cultural messaging against queerness. And while a subversive counterculture remained active, particularly in the cultural epicenter of Seoul, by necessity queerness was almost always pushed underground, hidden, or camouflaged.

This project is part of an attempt to make these histories and spaces more visible in a way that touches both past and present. It might serve as a learning resource, or as a tour guide for your next trip to Seoul.
