## Citation
This project is based on the work of 
- Todd A. Henry, "Gay and Queer Map of Authoritarian-Era Seoul (1950-1990)" [prepared for film premiere of 'Paradise' (Minki Hong, Director, and Todd A. Henry, Producer), December 2022]. 

Neighborhood descriptions are copied directly from his lecture pamphlet on gay spatiality in authoritarian-era Seoul (see below). Everything else is written in my own words â€” but the inspiration for this project and, widely, its informational credit, go to Professor Henry and should be cited accordingly.
